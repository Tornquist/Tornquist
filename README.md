Hi, I'm Nathan.

I'm a software engineer living and working in Chicago.

I'm currently working at [Google][0] and am building a yet-to-be-named
[time analysis platform][1] on the side. Previously, I led cloud services at [Auterion][2],
was the CTO at [SkinIO][3] and co-founded [Uplink Sports][4] with my [brother][5].
